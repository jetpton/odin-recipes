        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><b>Certainly! Here's a classic recipe for a delicious steak:</b></p>
        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li id="steaks">1 to 2 steaks (such as ribeye, sirloin, or filet mignon), about 1 inch thick
            </li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste
            </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil or other high-heat oil </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons of butte</li>
            <li>Optional: minced garlic, fresh herbs (such as thyme or rosemary)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take the steaks out of the refrigerator and let them come to room temperature for about 30 minutes. This helps them cook more evenly</li>
            <li>Preheat your grill or stovetop skillet over high heat. If using a grill, make sure it is clean and preheated. If using a skillet, choose a heavy-bottomed one that retains heat well.</li>
            <li>While the grill or skillet is heating, season the steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides. You can also add minced garlic or fresh herbs for extra flavor</li>
            <li>Drizzle the steaks with the vegetable oil, rubbing it in gently to ensure the steaks are evenly coated</li>
            <li>If using a grill, place the steaks on the hot grill grates. If using a skillet, add the steaks directly to the hot skillet. Cook the steaks for about 4-5 minutes per side for medium-rare, or adjust the cooking time according to your desired level of doneness.</li>
            <li>For a medium-rare steak, aim for an internal temperature of 130-135°F (55-57°C). You can use a meat thermometer to check the temperature. Remember that the steak will continue to cook as it rests.</li>
            <li>Just before the steaks are done, add the butter to the skillet or grill, allowing it to melt and coat the steaks. If desired, you can also add a sprig of fresh herbs to the butter for additional flavor.</li>
            <li>Remove the steaks from the heat and let them rest for about 5 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, resulting in a more tender and flavorful steak</li>
            <li>Slice the steaks against the grain and serve them hot. They pair well with roasted potatoes, steamed vegetables, or a fresh salad</li>
    
        </ol>
